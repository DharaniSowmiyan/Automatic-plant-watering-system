# Automatic-plant-watering-system
An automatic plant watering system using Arduino UNO and a soil moisture sensor to detect soil moisture levels and activate a water pump, ensuring optimal irrigation without human intervention.

# 🌿 Automatic Plant Watering System

## 🚀 Overview
The Automatic Plant Watering System is designed to efficiently water plants without human intervention. It uses an Arduino UNO board and a soil moisture sensor to monitor the soil's moisture level. When the moisture falls below a predefined threshold, the system activates a water pump, providing irrigation until the soil reaches the desired moisture level. The system is ideal for gardening, farming, and plant care automation.

## 📊 Circuit Diagram and Working
1. The soil moisture sensor measures the soil's humidity level.
2. If the moisture level is low, the Arduino sends a signal to the relay module.
3. The relay activates the water pump, which irrigates the soil.
4. The LCD displays the status of the system.
5. Once the soil reaches the required moisture level, the pump automatically stops.
